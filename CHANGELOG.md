# CHANGELOG

## 0.4.1

### Noticeable Changes

- Updated style
- Added multiselection option, see https://github.com/vigetlabs/ars-arsenal/pull/14
- Fixed an issue with Picker `onExit` where "Cancel" clicks could bubble and immediately re-open the Picker dialog

### Upgrading

- The style folder for ars-arsenal is now placed within `ars-arsenal/style`. For those on 0.3.0, you will need to change this path.
